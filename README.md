# 🏗️ Architecture Projects

This repository collects advanced backend and system design projects focused on **software architecture**, including:

- Clean Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Design Patterns
- Scalable system decomposition
- CI/CD integration
- Testing and modularization

These projects are aligned with the `Architect Track` roadmap and serve as **learning and demonstration grounds** for building resilient, maintainable, and production-ready software systems.

## 🧱 What you'll find here

| Project                    | Architecture Focus        | Description |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| `clean-node-api`           | Clean Architecture, SOLID | A REST API applying Clean Architecture principles in Node.js |
| `nestjs-ddd-example`       | DDD + Modular Monolith    | NestJS project applying DDD layers with testing and CI/CD |
| `ci-cd-pipeline-github`    | CI/CD                     | Automated workflows for testing, build and deployment using GitHub Actions |
| `modular-auth-service`     | System Decomposition      | Authentication microservice designed with modular boundaries and testing in mind |

> Note: These projects may evolve over time as the learning journey progresses.
