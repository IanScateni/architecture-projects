# 🏗️ Architecture Projects

This repository collects advanced backend and system design projects focused on **software architecture**, including:

- Clean Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Design Patterns
- Scalable system decomposition
- CI/CD integration
- Testing and modularization

These projects are aligned with the `Architect Track` roadmap and serve as **learning and demonstration grounds** for building resilient, maintainable, and production-ready software systems.
